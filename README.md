# <Generate-Team-Profile>

## Description

The main motivation behind building this project a team profile, so that the manager can have all the information about the employee and intern. Manager will be able to keep the record and contact by using the stored information. I also wanted to know more about node inquirer and generate html in a seprate folder.

The reason to build this project was to make it easier for the manager to access information about their employee and staff when he need it. I also wanted to apply the knowledge that I had gained and use it in this project.

The main problem that it solve is for the manager where he can generate html when he/she enters the information of engineer, and intern. He/she can easily have access to it.

What i learned by building this project was that I was able to use array, inquirer, test and generating html in a seprate folder. I found what i need to improve working on and create a better version of this project.
